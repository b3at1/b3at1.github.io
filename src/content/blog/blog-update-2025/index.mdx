# Howdy, Everyone!
I don't really feel like making blog updates anymore, but it's nice to reflect back on the things I've done so here's a short one. I may decide not to post blog updates in the future ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

## Things I Learned/Did
- competed with TAMU and won first at [ISTS](https://engineering.tamu.edu/news/2025/05/aggies-win-cybersecurity-competition.html)
- somehow maintained the 4.0 GPA
- got absolutely *decimated* by puzzles from [The Little Book of Semaphores](https://greenteapress.com/semaphores/LittleBookOfSemaphores.pdf)
- learned a great recipe for tandoori chicken
- started learning malware development

## Life Updates
I had to privilege to intern at [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.com/) this summer. It was a great time and I loved being out in NoVA. I'm super thankful to have had the opportunity to research, build, test, and fine tune detections, and I learned a lot over the 10 weeks I spent as a detection engineer.

## Looking Forward
- I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do. I enjoy aspects of both blue and red team, and I've decided to to remain open minded to various roles for the time being.
- I want to cook more. I especially love Mexican Cuisine, Indian Cuisine, and Texas Style BBQ so I hope to share a recipe or two here in the future whenever I 'make it my own.'
- I've added a minor in Music Technology, so I'm looking forward to learning more about music production and any software/hardware tooling that can be used to accomplish it.
